      question: "Is a home visit safe and hygienic for my pet?",

      question: "What if my pet becomes aggressive during the visit?",

        "Trained vets know how to handle nervous or aggressive pets gently. You can also inform the service in advance so the vet can come prepared.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer emergency vet home visits?",
      answer:
        "Some services offer urgent or same-day appointments, but true medical emergencies like severe injuries, poisoning, or seizures still require immediate clinic or hospital care.",
